# AkashClient Auto-Loading Credentials Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented automatic credential loading from ProviderConfig using GetProviderConfigReference in the AkashClient, where controllers receive ready-to-use clients.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced AkashClient Structure (`internal/controller/client/client.go`)

#### New Types Added:
- `ProviderConfigInfo`: Struct containing credentials source and selectors from ProviderConfig
- Enhanced `AkashClient` with fields for managed resource tracking and usage monitoring

#### New Constructor Methods:
- **`NewFromManagedResource()`**: Main new constructor that:
  - Accepts managed resource, Kubernetes client, usage tracker, and ProviderConfig info
  - Automatically loads credentials from ProviderConfig
  - Sets up credential caching and secret references
  - Tracks ProviderConfig usage
  - Returns ready-to-use client with credentials pre-loaded

#### Enhanced Functionality:
- Automatic credential loading and caching
- Support for credential refresh from secrets
- Thread-safe credential operations
- Backward compatibility with existing constructors

### 2. Updated Deployment Controller (`internal/controller/deployment/deployment.go`)

#### New Service Constructor:
- **`newDeploymentServiceFromManagedResource()`**: Creates DeploymentService with auto-loading credentials

#### Enhanced Connector:
- Added `createServiceFromManagedResourceFn` field for new constructor
- Updated `Connect()` method to use new approach as primary method
- Maintains backward compatibility with fallback constructors

#### Connect Method Flow:
1. **Primary**: Use `NewFromManagedResource()` - handles everything internally
2. **Fallback 1**: Use `NewFromProviderConfig()` - enhanced method
3. **Fallback 2**: Use legacy `New()` method - for compatibility

### 3. Updated Examples (`examples/client-usage/main.go`)
- Demonstrated all usage patterns including the new approach
- Showed automatic credential loading capabilities
- Provided documentation for controller usage

## Key Benefits

### 1. **Automatic Credential Management**
- Controllers no longer need to manually handle ProviderConfig loading
- Credentials are automatically extracted and cached
- Secret references are set up automatically for refresh capability

### 2. **Ready-to-Use Clients**
- `Connect()` method returns fully configured client
- No additional setup required in controller logic
- Credentials are pre-loaded and validated

### 3. **Enhanced Caching**
- Intelligent credential caching with configurable TTL
- Automatic refresh from secrets when cache expires
- Thread-safe credential operations

### 4. **Backward Compatibility**
- All existing constructors still work
- Gradual migration path available
- No breaking changes to existing code

### 5. **Proper Resource Tracking**
- Automatic ProviderConfig usage tracking
- Follows Crossplane best practices
- Integrated with controller-runtime patterns

## Usage in Controllers

### Before (Manual approach):
```go
// Controller had to manually load credentials
pc := &apisv1alpha1.ProviderConfig{}
c.kube.Get(ctx, types.NamespacedName{Name: cr.GetProviderConfigReference().Name}, pc)
creds, err := resource.CommonCredentialExtractor(ctx, pc.Spec.Credentials.Source, c.kube, pc.Spec.Credentials.CommonCredentialSelectors)
client := akashclient.New(ctx, akashclient.AkashProviderConfiguration{Creds: creds})
```

### After (Automatic approach):
```go
// Controller receives ready-to-use client automatically
// The Connect() method handles everything internally:
// 1. Loads ProviderConfig
// 2. Extracts credentials 
// 3. Sets up caching
// 4. Tracks usage
// 5. Returns ready client
svc, err := c.createServiceFromManagedResourceFn(ctx, c.kube, c.usage, mg, pcInfo, config)
```

## Implementation Details

### Credential Loading Flow:
1. `NewFromManagedResource()` called with managed resource and ProviderConfig info
2. Credentials extracted using `resource.CommonCredentialExtractor()`
3. Secret reference set up if using secret-based credentials
4. Credentials cached with timestamp and TTL
5. ProviderConfig usage tracked
6. Ready-to-use client returned

### Caching Strategy:
- Default 5-minute TTL for credential cache
- Thread-safe read/write operations using `sync.RWMutex`
- Automatic refresh on cache expiration
- Manual refresh capability via `RefreshCredentials()`

### Error Handling:
- Comprehensive error wrapping with context
- Fallback mechanisms for different constructor types
- Validation of ProviderConfig references
- Graceful handling of missing or invalid credentials

## Testing
- All existing tests pass
- Build verification successful
- Backward compatibility confirmed
- Examples compile and demonstrate functionality

## Next Steps
- Controllers can now use the enhanced `Connect()` method
- Credentials are automatically managed without additional code
- Caching and refresh happen transparently
- Ready for production use with improved reliability and performance
